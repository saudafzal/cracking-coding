// Question 1.4: Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function
// to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome.

// Making a Hashtable<Character, Integer> and iterating through string to store counts of each
// char in the Hashtable. Then, iterate through Hashtable, counting the number of characters which
// have an odd count. If this number exceeds one, return false.

// There are still problems with my solution. For example, I have to change it so it ignores spaces.
// "Tact Coa", the example in the book, should be considered a palindrome permutation which it doesn't
// do currently. I should also probably have it accept the empty string as a valid input, and multiple
// words separated by spaces (again, as in the "Tact Coa" example). Also, my program is case-sensitive,
// which could be changed or made into an option selected by the user.

// In the book solution, they made a hashtable themselves using an array and with the assumption
// that the only characters we care about are a-z. That's an interesting and better solution.
