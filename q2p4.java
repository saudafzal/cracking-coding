// Question 2.4: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
// less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
// Idea: Make 2 new linked lists, list1 to contain elements smaller or equal to x, list2 to contain larger elements.
// Traverse through list. Elements smaller than x get prepended to list1, elements equal get appended. Elements larger get appended to list2.
// Join the 2 lists.
// Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(n).

    // just finished making new linked list constructor which simply takes in array and converts it to linked list
  }
